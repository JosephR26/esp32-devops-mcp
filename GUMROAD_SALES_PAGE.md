## Product Description (Main Sales Copy)

### Stop Wasting Hours on Repetitive ESP32 Tasks

Every day you:
- ❌ Type the same PlatformIO commands over and over
- ❌ Hunt for COM ports in Device Manager
- ❌ Manually watch serial output for memory leaks
- ❌ Context-switch between 5 different terminals
- ❌ Ship bugs you could've caught with better testing

**What if you could just... ask?**

---

### Introducing ESP32 DevOps MCP Server

The first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server specifically built for embedded systems development.

**Instead of this:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
pio run -e esp32dev

# Terminal 2
# Wait... which COM port?
# Open Device Manager...

# Terminal 3
pio run --target upload --upload-port COM7

# Terminal 4
pio device monitor

# Now check for memory leaks manually...
# Add printf statements...
# Rebuild...
# Reflash...
# Watch for 30 minutes...
```

**You do this:**
```
You: "Build my ESP32 project, flash it, and check for memory leaks"

Claude:
✓ Building firmware... Success
✓ Memory usage: RAM 45%, Flash 62%
✓ Auto-detected ESP32 on COM7
✓ Flashing... Complete (12 seconds)
✓ Running 5-minute memory leak test...
✓ Analysis: No memory leaks detected
✓ Loop performance: 8ms average (excellent)
✓ Ready for deployment ✓
```

**That's the power of AI + automation.**
