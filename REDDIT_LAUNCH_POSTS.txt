TITLE:
[Project] I built an MCP server for ESP32 development with Claude Code

BODY:
Hey r/esp32!

I got tired of typing the same PlatformIO commands 50 times a day, so I built an MCP server that lets you control your entire ESP32 workflow through natural language with Claude Code.

**What it does:**

Instead of this:
- Manually checking COM ports in Device Manager
- Typing `pio run -e esp32dev`
- Waiting for build...
- Typing `pio run --target upload --upload-port COM7`
- Opening serial monitor in another terminal
- Manually checking for memory leaks

You can just tell Claude:
- "Build my ESP32 project and flash it"
- "Check for memory leaks"
- "Is this firmware ready for production?"

**Features:**
✓ Auto-detect ESP32 devices
✓ One-command build + flash + monitor
✓ Automated performance benchmarking
✓ Memory leak detection
✓ Pre-deployment validation
✓ 14 DevOps tools total

**Links:**
- GitHub (free version): https://github.com/JosephR26/esp32-devops-mcp
- Full version: [Your Gumroad link here]

Built this over the last few days. Would love feedback from the community!

What ESP32 workflows are you tired of doing manually?

==================
POST 2: r/ClaudeAI
==================

TITLE:
First MCP server for ESP32/embedded development is live!

BODY:
I built the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server specifically for embedded systems development.

**The Problem:**
Claude is amazing for writing ESP32 firmware, but couldn't actually BUILD it, FLASH it, or TEST it. You still had to context-switch to terminals and manually execute everything.

**The Solution:**
ESP32 DevOps MCP - 14 tools that let Claude handle the entire development workflow.

**Example conversation:**

You: "Build my ESP32 project, flash it, and check for memory leaks"

Claude:
✓ Building firmware... Success (Flash: 62%, RAM: 45%)
✓ Auto-detected ESP32 on COM7
✓ Flashing... Complete (12 seconds)
✓ Running 5-minute memory leak test...
✓ Analysis: No leaks detected
✓ Loop performance: 8ms average
✓ Status: Ready for deployment ✓

**Tools included:**
- Smart serial port management
- Build & flash automation
- Performance benchmarking
- Automated testing

**Links:**

This is just the start - planning Hardware Docs MCP, OTA Manager MCP, and more.

What other embedded development tasks should Claude be able to handle?

==================
POST 3: r/embedded
==================

TITLE:
Built an MCP server that automates embedded development workflows

BODY:
For anyone using Claude Code/Claude Pro for embedded development - I built an MCP server that automates the build-test-deploy cycle.

**Why this matters:**

Most AI coding assistants can write firmware code, but can't actually:
- Build it
- Flash it to hardware
- Test it for bugs
- Validate deployment readiness

This MCP server bridges that gap for ESP32 (and soon Arduino, STM32, etc.)

**What it automates:**
✓ Serial port detection (no more hunting for COM ports)
✓ Build automation (PlatformIO integration)
✓ Flashing with auto-retry
✓ Memory leak detection
✓ Performance benchmarking
✓ Pre-deployment validation

**Tech stack:**
- TypeScript/Node.js MCP server
- Wraps PlatformIO CLI
- Python-based testing tools
- Works with Claude Code/Desktop

Open to feedback and contributions!

==================
POST 4: r/PlatformIO
==================

TITLE:
MCP server for PlatformIO automation with Claude Code

BODY:
I built an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets you control PlatformIO through natural language via Claude Code.

**What you can do:**

Instead of typing:
```bash
pio run -e esp32dev
pio run --target upload --upload-port COM7
pio device monitor
```

You say:
"Build my ESP32 project and flash it to COM7"

And Claude executes the entire workflow.

**Features:**
- Automatic environment detection
- Serial port auto-discovery
- Build output parsing
- Memory usage analysis
- Error detection and reporting

**Why this is useful:**
- Faster iteration (30 seconds vs 15 minutes)
- No context switching
- Automated testing workflows
- Perfect for CI/CD integration

**GitHub:** https://github.com/JosephR26/esp32-devops-mcp

Built for ESP32 first, but architecture supports any PlatformIO platform.

Feedback welcome!
