## REDDIT LAUNCH POST TEMPLATES

### r/esp32 Launch Post

**Title:** [Project] I built an MCP server for ESP32 development with Claude Code

**Body:**
```
Hey r/esp32!

I got tired of typing the same PlatformIO commands 50 times a day, so I built an MCP server that lets you control your entire ESP32 workflow through natural language with Claude Code.

**What it does:**

Instead of this:
- Manually checking COM ports in Device Manager
- Typing `pio run -e esp32dev`
- Waiting for build...
- Typing `pio run --target upload --upload-port COM7`
- Opening serial monitor in another terminal
- Manually checking for memory leaks

You can just tell Claude:
- "Build my ESP32 project and flash it"
- "Check for memory leaks"
- "Is this firmware ready for production?"

**Features:**
✓ Auto-detect ESP32 devices
✓ One-command build + flash + monitor
✓ Automated performance benchmarking
✓ Memory leak detection
✓ Pre-deployment validation
✓ 14 DevOps tools total

**GitHub (free version):** https://github.com/JosephR26/esp32-devops-mcp

**Demo:** [Video showing Claude building and flashing ESP32 firmware]

Built this over the weekend. Would love feedback from the community!

What ESP32 workflows are you tired of doing manually?
```

### r/ClaudeAI Launch Post

**Title:** First MCP server for ESP32 development is live!

**Body:**
```
I built the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server specifically for embedded systems development.

**The Problem:**
Claude is amazing for writing ESP32 firmware, but couldn't actually BUILD it, FLASH it, or TEST it. You still had to context-switch to terminals and manually execute everything.

**The Solution:**
ESP32 DevOps MCP - 14 tools that let Claude handle the entire development workflow.

**Example conversation:**

You: "Build my ESP32 project, flash it, and check for memory leaks"

Claude:
✓ Building firmware... Success (Flash: 62%, RAM: 45%)
✓ Auto-detected ESP32 on COM7
✓ Flashing... Complete (12 seconds)
✓ Running 5-minute memory leak test...
✓ Analysis: No leaks detected
✓ Loop performance: 8ms average
✓ Status: Ready for deployment ✓

**Tools included:**
- Smart serial port management
- Build & flash automation
- Performance benchmarking
- Automated testing
- And more...

**GitHub:** https://github.com/JosephR26/esp32-devops-mcp

This is just the start - planning Hardware Docs MCP, OTA Manager MCP, and more.

What other embedded development tasks should Claude be able to handle?
```

## ENTERPRISE OUTREACH EMAIL TEMPLATE

**Subject:** Custom MCP Development for [Company Name]'s IoT Platform

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is building [specific IoT product/platform - show you did research].

I recently built the first MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for ESP32 development that's gained traction in the embedded community (GitHub: [link]).

**I'm reaching out because:**

MCP servers can dramatically accelerate IoT development workflows by letting AI handle DevOps, testing, and deployment tasks. Based on [Company Name]'s work with [specific technology], I see several high-value opportunities:

1. Custom firmware testing automation
2. Fleet deployment management
3. Production validation tools
4. [Specific use case for their product]

**What I'm proposing:**
A 15-minute call to explore if a custom MCP server could accelerate your team's development velocity. No obligation.

**Recent work:**
- 14 production MCP tools built
- Handles build, flash, test, deploy workflows
- Cuts development iteration time from 15 min → 30 sec

Available for a quick call this week?

Best,
Joseph
