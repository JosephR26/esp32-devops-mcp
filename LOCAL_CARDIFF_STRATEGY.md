## 🚶 Field Visit Protocol

### **Preparation:**
- Laptop fully charged + demo ready
- Business cards in pocket (25-50)
- One-page leave-behinds (10-20)
- Notebook for notes
- Professional but casual dress (Cardiff industrial = no suit needed)

### **The Approach:**

**Step 1: Reception**
"Hi, I'm Joseph, I'm a local developer based here in CF24. I build AI automation tools for hardware and IoT companies. Is there someone I could speak with about your development or engineering operations?"

**Step 2: Quick Qualifying Questions** (if you get to talk to someone)
- "Do you develop embedded systems or IoT devices?"
- "What's your current development workflow like?"
- "Do you use ESP32, Arduino, STM32, or similar?"

**Step 3: The Hook** (if qualified)
"I've built tools that automate the entire build-test-deploy cycle using AI. Can I show you a quick 2-minute demo?"

**Step 4: Demo** (LIVE, not slides)
- Open laptop
- Show Claude Code
- "Build and flash my ESP32 project" → executed live
- "This normally takes 10-15 minutes of manual work"
- "Now it's 30 seconds"

**Step 5: The Ask**
"Would it be valuable to explore custom automation tools for your team's specific workflow? I'm doing free consultations this week."

**Step 6: Leave Materials**
- Business card
- One-pager
- "Feel free to check out my GitHub - it's all open source"
- "Email me anytime: josephreilly19@outlook.com"

### **What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Don't be pushy
- ❌ Don't take more than 5 minutes unless invited
- ❌ Don't badmouth competitors
- ❌ Don't promise anything you can't deliver

### **Success Metrics:**
- **Great:** 1 interested contact per 5 visits
- **Good:** Meeting scheduled for next week
- **Acceptable:** "Email me your details"
- **Learning:** "Not interested" (ask why, learn, adjust)

## 🚀 The Cardiff + Online Combo

**This is YOUR unfair advantage:**

**Most developers:** Build online products, compete globally (hard)
**You:** Build online products (global reach) + Local B2B (fast cash)

- **Online:** Passive, scalable, slow to build
- **Local:** Active, limited scale, FAST cash flow

**Use local cash to fund online growth**
**Use online credibility to close local deals**

**This is the empire formula.** 🏰
