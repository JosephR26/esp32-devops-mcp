========================================
TWITTER LAUNCH THREAD - READY TO POST
========================================

TWEET 1 (Hook):
I just launched the first MCP server for ESP32 development.

Now Claude Code can build, flash, test, and deploy firmware with natural language commands.

Thread on how I built this in a weekend (and why it matters) 🧵👇

---

TWEET 2 (Problem):
The problem with AI coding assistants:

They can write great firmware code, but can't actually:
• Build it
• Flash it to hardware
• Test for bugs
• Validate deployment

You still do all that manually. 😤

---

TWEET 3 (Solution):
So I built an MCP server that bridges the gap.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets Claude Code execute tools on your machine.

My server wraps the entire ESP32 DevOps workflow.

Now you can just... ask. 💬

---

TWEET 4 (Demo):
Instead of typing commands:
```
pio run -e esp32dev
pio run --target upload --upload-port COM7
pio device monitor
```

You say:
"Build and flash my ESP32 project"

Claude handles everything. ⚡

---

TWEET 5 (Features):
What it does:

✓ Auto-detect ESP32 devices
✓ Build automation with memory analysis
✓ One-command flash workflows
✓ Automated performance benchmarking
✓ Memory leak detection
✓ Pre-deployment validation

14 tools total.

---

TWEET 6 (Tech):
Built with:
• TypeScript/Node.js MCP server
• PlatformIO CLI integration
• Python testing tools
• Works with Claude Code/Desktop

Open source core + paid pro features.

---

TWEET 7 (Why it matters):
This isn't just about convenience.

It's about AI agents actually DOING things, not just writing code.

Build → Test → Deploy
All automated through conversation.

This is the future of development. 🚀

---

TWEET 8 (Results):
Time saved per iteration:
• Before: 15 minutes
• After: 30 seconds
• Speedup: 30x faster

And it catches bugs I'd miss manually.

Perfect for:
• Solo devs
• IoT startups
• Hardware makers

---

TWEET 9 (CTA):
Free version on GitHub:
https://github.com/JosephR26/esp32-devops-mcp

Full version (14 tools):
[Your Gumroad link]

Built this in public - happy to answer questions! 👇

---

TWEET 10 (Roadmap):
What's next:
• Arduino support (this weekend)
• STM32 support
• Hardware documentation generator
• OTA update manager
• Full MCP marketplace

Building in public. Follow along! 🛠️

---

OPTIONAL TWEET 11 (Engagement):
If you're building with ESP32/embedded systems:

What manual tasks do you hate the most?

Might build MCP tools for those next. 💡
